### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Although we only got to do one part for lab 1, it was my favorite because it was an amazing introduction to the class. I got a general idea and familiarity with GitHub and without this lab, I do not think I would be able to continue in the class. Lab one allowed me to further strengthen my GitHub knowledge and gave me confidence toward future labs with a positive attitude. 

* Lab 3
    I enjoyed working on lab 3 because it was when I started to get a feel for the labs. This lab provided me with comfort and confidence moving forward. I also enjoyed this lab because I met a friend who was my partner. She and I ended up working on two labs together enjoying both as much as we possibly could. 

* Lab 10
    The final lab that I enjoyed was lab 10. Although my partner and I did not see eye to eye on every aspect of the lab, we worked our way through it and ended up finishing it together. This lab taught me that not everyone is going to agree with you and that part of being a computer scientist is learning how to take constructive criticism.
